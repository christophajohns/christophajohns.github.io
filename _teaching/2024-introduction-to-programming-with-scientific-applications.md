I assisted the teaching of the course ["Introduction to Programming with Scientific Applications"](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/123832/Introduction-to-Programming-with-Scientific-Applications) at Aarhus University in the spring semester 2024. The course is part of the Bachelor's programmes at the Natural Sciences. The course is taught by [Gerth St√∏lting Brodal](https://www.au.dk/gerth@cs.au.dk). I was responsible for the exercise sessions and support of the students' individual and group projects.
