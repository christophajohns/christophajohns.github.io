I assisted the teaching of the course ["Augmented Reality"](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/130534/Augmented-Reality) at Aarhus University in the spring semester 2024. The course is part of the Bachelor's programmes at the Natural Sciences. The course is taught by [Ken Pfeuffer](https://www.au.dk/ken@cs.au.dk). I was responsible for the exercise sessions and support of the students' individual and group projects.
