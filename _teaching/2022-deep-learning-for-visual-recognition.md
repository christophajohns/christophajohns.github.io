I assisted the teaching of the course ["Deep Learning for Visual Recognition"](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/114392/Deep-Learning-for-Visual-Recognition) at Aarhus University in the fall semester 2022. The course is part of the Master's programme in Computer Science. The course is taught by [Henrik Pedersen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/cajohns@cs.au.dk). I was responsible for the exercise sessions and support of the students' individual and group projects.
