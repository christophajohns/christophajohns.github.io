I assisted the teaching of the course ["Human-Computer Interaction"](https://kursuskatalog.au.dk/en/course/120266/Human-Computer-Interaction) at Aarhus University in the fall semester 2023. The course is part of the Bachelor's programme in Computer Science. The course is taught by [Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/clemens@cs.au.dk). I was responsible for the exercise sessions and support of the students' individual and group projects.
