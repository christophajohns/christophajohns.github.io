Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christoph, a double degree master's student in Human-Computer Interaction and Design at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden, and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) in Helsinki/Espoo, Finland. Currently, I am completing an internship at the [User Interfaces Research Group](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi) at Aalto University. I have a background in business administration and business information systems, but have dedicated my time and resources to studies and work in the domain of software design and Human-Computer Interaction in general. It is my goal and passion to contribute to innovation and learning in designing digital services and I have wasted countless hours on this topic.

## Work and Research

I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to research and design software and computer systems for business and academia. My previous work and studies have, for example, focused on: cognitive modeling, computational interaction, physical interaction, multimodal interaction, augmented reality and app and web development. I have worked in and with small startups and local non-profit organizations (e.g. [ArbeiterKind e.V. GÃ¶ttingen](https://www.arbeiterkind.de)), rapidly growing scaleups (e.g. [ABOUT YOU](https://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/)) as well as large multinational companies and institutions (e.g. [Volkswagen Financial Services](https://www.vwfs.com/en.html), [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en)). Throughout my work and studies, I have gained insights and experience in what I consider to be the three pillars of digital innovation: technology, design and business.

## Background and History

I received a B.Sc. from the [Business Information Systems program](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/640687.html) at University of GÃ¶ttingen and a B.A. from the [Business Administration program](https://www.welfenakademie.de/studienaufbau/) at WelfenAkademie Braunschweig. Before pursuing my studies in Business Information Systems and later Human-Computer Interaction and Design, I was a dual study program student at [Volkswagen Financial Services](https://www.vwfs.com/en.html) in Braunschweig, Germany.
