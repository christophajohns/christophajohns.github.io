Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christoph, a PhD student in Human-Computer Interaction at the Department of Computer Science at [Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk/research/ubiquitous-computing-and-interaction) in Aarhus, Denmark. Before starting my PhD studies, I completed a double degree master's programme in Human-Computer Interaction and Design at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, Sweden, and [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) in Helsinki/Espoo, Finland. I conducted my master thesis at the [Interactive Machine Learning Lab](https://iml.dfki.de) of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). Before, I was an intern in the [User Interfaces Research Group](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi) at Aalto University. I have a background in business administration and business information systems, but have since found my passion for the design of intelligent interactive systems and Human-Computer Interaction in general.

## Work and Research

I use qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to research and design software and computer systems for business and academia. My previous work and studies have, for example, focused on: adaptive user interfaces, computational interaction, cognitive modeling, physical interaction, multimodal interaction, augmented reality and app and web development. I have worked in and with small startups and local non-profit organizations (e.g. [ArbeiterKind e.V. GÃ¶ttingen](https://www.arbeiterkind.de)), rapidly growing scaleups (e.g. [ABOUT YOU](https://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/)) as well as large multinational companies and institutions (e.g. [Volkswagen Financial Services](https://www.vwfs.com/en.html), [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en)). Throughout my work and studies, I have gained insights and experience in what I consider to be the three pillars of digital innovation: technology, design and business.

## Background and History

I received a M.Sc. (Double Degree) from the [Human-Computer Interaction and Design program](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/human-computer-interaction-and-design) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Aalto University organized by the [EIT Digital Master School](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/). Prior, I received a B.Sc. from the [Business Information Systems program](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/640687.html) at University of GÃ¶ttingen and a B.A. from the [Business Administration program](https://www.welfenakademie.de/studienaufbau/) at WelfenAkademie Braunschweig. Before pursuing my studies in Business Information Systems and later Human-Computer Interaction and Design, I was a dual study program student at [Volkswagen Financial Services](https://www.vwfs.com/en.html) in Braunschweig, Germany.
