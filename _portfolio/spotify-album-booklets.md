Primarily based on in-depth interviews with up-and-coming artists and supplemented by additional methods such as literature search and forum reviews, our project identified the problem statement “Up-and-coming artists need to be able to succinctly express their own identity on Spotify because Spotify is currently focussed on distribution instead of expression.” as a relevant starting point for our design process. This problem was further narrowed down and operationalised into the “How Might We” (HMW) question “How might we translate the experience of an album booklet into a digital format?” We decided to focus on album booklets as they constitute a formerly important and valuable form of expression for artists as well as an opportunity for deeper engagement with an album for serious listeners and fans that has yet to translate to the primary platforms for digital music distribution and consumption. If translated into an attractive digital format, they could, furthermore, provide artists with an additional tool to promote their music between releases (e.g. on creative breaks) which we identified as an important theme during our analysis.

Our proposed design addresses these concerns by introducing the following core features to the Spotify mobile application:

(1) Artists can add supplemental multimedia content to their albums through a block-style WYSIWYG editor. These blocks include, for example, media content (e.g. images, links), Spotify elements (e.g. songs, podcast episodes), cross-selling elements (e.g. merchandise offers, tour dates), social elements (e.g. top highlights, critical reviews), and Spotify-generated user statistics (e.g. similar to “Spotify Wrapped”).

(2) Artists can promote these booklets and thereby their music through card-style placements on their fans’ home tab.

(3) Listeners can access, interact with, and save booklets. The links to these booklets are stored in a new “Booklets'' tab in their personal library.

(4) Albums that include booklets are highlighted through a new icon for increased visibility.

Illustrative screenshots for all four core features can be found in Figure 1. The full interactive Figma prototype can be accessed at: <https://www.figma.com/proto/w5VzY5xQBazuBNG7LDZOfC/Mockup?node-id=5%3A2&viewport=-1085%2C-2587%2C0.39961978793144226&scaling=scale-down>. The artist flow (i.e. a quick prototype of the proposed WYSIWYG editor) can be accessed via the cog wheel icon (“settings”) on the home tab.
