From lighting conditions to temperature and air quality, there are many
physical parameters that affect employee productivity and well-being in an
office. These so-called environmental stressors usually account for
differences in individual performance in the range of 2.4% to 5.8%â€”but it can
be as much as 14.8% under especially unpleasant conditions. With the COVID-19
pandemic adding to this existing issue, safe and healthy work environments
have become more important than ever. Monitoring the potentially harmful
parameters at their workplace can, therefore, significantly support users in
achieving their personal goals while keeping their health and safety in check.

Our business solution is an interactive mobile app that acts as a health and
safety monitoring service largely remaining in the background but which can
provide extensive information about the work environment on-demand. Users can
access and view current levels of physical parameters across offices and
buildings, including historical trends and context. To give one example, the
app contains a so-called "surroundings map" displaying live noise and light
levels including their general location, giving the user a more spatial look
into the noise or light environment at any given desk. To further support
users' in maintaining good health, the app provides local notification alerts
and recommendations to, for example, take a break or switch to a more suitable
work environment.

As our service heavily relies on sensor data gathered by office space
providers, our target customers are these office space providers while the
users of our application are their customers, the office space users. Our main
revenue stream is to incur a license fee from office space providers for the
services we can provide to their customers. This income will primarily offset
the research and development costs associated with the design and
customisation of the necessary software based on user and customer
requirements.
