            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>I am a first-year student in the joint double-degree Master of Science programme in EIT Digital Human-Computer Interaction and Design between KTH Royal Institute of Technology (entry university) and Aalto University (exit university). Before joining the masterâ€™s, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Business Information Systems at University of Goettingen and a Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration at WelfenAkademie Braunschweig as well as an apprenticeship in banking at Volkswagen Financial Services. Even though I have a strong background in business, I want to explore and pursue a career in academia, specifically in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a first-year student in the Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction and Design programme at EIT Digital between KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Aalto University. Currently, he is taking in courses in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Research and Methodology, and Business. After completing the master's programme in 2022, he will receive degrees from both universities participating in the joint programme.</p>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>I would love to talk to you about Human-Computer Interaction, Innovation Management, or anything related to scientific research. If you feel like it, I would even be happy to talk about why I chose this old-school HTML page for my personal website despite pursuing a degree in Design.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I have a diverse academic and practical background with excellent grades on the bachelor's level. I graduated top of class in both of my bachelor's degrees and am a fast and eager learner.</p>

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>If you liked my Curriculum Vitae or this personal website, I would love to hear back from you about any open positions or internships relating to research in Human-Computer Interaction. Let's talk!</p>
