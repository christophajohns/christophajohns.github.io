This research project investigates the effect of real-time light estimation in augmented reality (AR) applications on immersion and on energy consumption in a pre-study with seven participants. A simple open-source card-matching game is modified to implement and control the corresponding rendering setting as provided by Appleâ€™s AR application programming interface (API) RealityKit and tested with a small convenience sample of users. A within-subject research design is chosen to measure immersion through the Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) while overall central processing unit (CPU) usage is monitored and logged for both test conditions in randomized order. A Mann-Whitney-U-test is used to test for significant differences in immersion and CPU usage between both conditions. The preliminary results seem to suggest that immersion is not significantly affected by real-time light estimation whereas CPU usage might be higher for the enabled condition, although a larger scale study is required for a more meaningful account. For such a large-scale study, usability issues of the sample application should be resolved. Additionally, it should be considered whether the IEQ should be replaced with a questionnaire that is more specific to AR applications.
