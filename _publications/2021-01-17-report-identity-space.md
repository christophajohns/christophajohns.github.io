Building on works that use biometric data to create multimodal art pieces, this project utilises the unique identification numbers in personal identification (ID) cards to create a shared audio-visual representation of a connected group’s background and composition. The four-byte identifier of the near-field communication (NFC) tag in each ID card is mapped to both visual (e.g. colour, position, size, and animation of displayed elements) and audio parameters (e.g. partials of an oscillator’s harmonic series; note, octave, and timing of a triggered sound) of the resulting art piece. In addition to the tangible input of the personal ID card, participants can use their smartphone’s touch screen to trigger the attack and release of the associated sound for their connected personal ID card. An explorative evaluation of the interaction shows that, while the art piece is considered attractive by the participants, it largely fails to elicit a strong reaction related to the concept of identity. Future works should focus on enhancing users’ perceived control of their contribution to the resulting art piece as well as the connection to participants’ personal data and characteristics, for example by making use of additional sensors of the connected smartphone or by employing more transparent parameter mapping.
