Sketching interfaces are widely used by designers to create visual prototypes. However, they are limited by the interaction techniques and the workflows that designers employ. Usually, a designer has to rely on a stylus or a mouse to manually create paper-like sketches throughout the process. Yet, novel interactive hardware (e.g., virtual reality, voice user interfaces, and shape-changing tangibles) has become widely available in recent years, and many novel computational methods have been proposed. I believe the intersection between sketching interfaces, advanced hardware, and computational methods is worth exploring. The aim of my research is to progress towards more natural and intelligent sketching interfaces. In order to achieve this goal, a deeper understanding of the process of sketching for graphical user interface design will be required. My research plan is, therefore, twofold: (1) re-define the design space for sketching in graphical user interface design with regard to their input and output modalities and underlying computational models and (2) introduce novel interactions to intelligent sketching interfaces to provoke new insights into the core characteristics of sketching. I anticipate that my research can act as a starting point for future systems and workflows of graphical user interface design that deeply integrate computational methods.
