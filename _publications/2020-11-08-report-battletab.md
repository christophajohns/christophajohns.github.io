This paper proposes using conductive materials in a non-conductive support to register the movement of tangible game pieces on a touch screen device. This enables players to use their existing game pieces in a digital or hybrid board game. The exploration, experimentation, and implementation of the prototype are described and the resulting game experi- ence is tested autobiographically and with users in completely face-to-face, mixed, and completely remote settings with a focus on the sense of presence enhanced by the prototype. The qualitative user evaluation confirms the system’s potential, but reliability and usability issues limit the sense of presence that can be achieved with the current iteration.
