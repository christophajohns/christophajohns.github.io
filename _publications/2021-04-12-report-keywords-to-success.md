The annual Best Paper awards at the Conference on Hu- man Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) reward outstanding research among the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community and constitutes one of the highest honours for HCI researchers. The selection process for these award winners is, however, informal and inherently intransparent. By training an unsupervised topic model on the author key- words of the Honorable Mentions and Best Paper winners at CHI 2016-2020, this paper identifies the most common themes among those highly acclaimed articles and sheds some light on their selection. The results seem to suggest a common theme around inclusive and ethical interaction design with some indication towards reviews and artifact- driven methods. The topic model has to be considered imprecise, however, and further research should focus on larger bodies of text such as article abstracts to achieve a more accurate model and more expressive results.
